## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

#Importing the required packages

```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(caret)
library(factoextra)
library(tidyverse)
set.seed(123)
```
#set working directory
```{r}
getwd()
```
# Reading the Pharmaceuticals Csv file
```{r}
Assign <- read.csv('Pharmaceuticals.csv')
```

```{r}
summary(Assign)
```
#cheaking for null values
```{r}
colSums(is.na(Assign))
```
#cheacking for numerical variables
```{r}
head(Assign)
```
#A Using only the numerical variables (1 to 9) to cluster the 21 firms. Justify the various choices made in 
conducting the cluster analysis, such as weights for different variables, the specific clustering algorithm(s) 
used, the number of clusters formed, and so on. 

```{r}
Assign_Numeric_Values <- Assign[,c(3:11)]#Columns upon which we want to cluster our datas.
Assign_Numeric_Values
```
```{r}
summary(Assign_Numeric_Values)#summary of the extracted columns
```
#scaling the numeric variables
```{r}
Scale_Assign <-scale(Assign_Numeric_Values)
D_Assign <- get_dist(Scale_Assign)
```
#To view and understand the distance matrix
```{r}
fviz_dist(D_Assign)
```
# Estimating the  number of clusters
# Using the Elbow Method on scaled data to determine the value of k
```{r}
fviz_nbclust(Scale_Assign,FUNcluster = kmeans,method = "wss")+labs(subtitle="Elbow Method")
```
According to the Elbow Method k=2

# Silhouette Method on scaled data to determine the number of clusters, Measures of Simirality and ranges
```{r}
fviz_nbclust(Scale_Assign,FUNcluster = kmeans,method = "silhouette")+labs(subtitle="Silhouette Method")
```
The plots reveal that 5 clusters are sufficient.
```{r}
set.seed(10)
Kmeans_D <- kmeans(Scale_Assign,centers=5,nstart=25) #k=5
Kmeans_D$centers   #Centroids
```
#Size of each cluster
```{r}
Kmeans_D$size
```
#Finding out the cluster of 8th observation in the dataset, we can similarly find the different observations of the dataset.
```{r}
Kmeans_D$cluster[8]
```
#Vizualizing the clusters
```{r}
fviz_cluster(Kmeans_D,data=Scale_Assign) 
```
```{r}
#K-Means Cluster Analysis - Fit the data with 5 clusters
Kmeans_N <- kmeans(Scale_Assign, 5)
aggregate(Scale_Assign,by=list(Kmeans_N$cluster),FUN=mean)
New_Assign <- as.data.frame(Scale_Assign, Kmeans_D$cluster)
New_Assign
```

#Visualization Of ClustPlot
```{r}
library(cluster)
clusplot(Scale_Assign ,Kmeans_N$cluster, color=TRUE, shade=TRUE, labels=2, lines=0)
```
#B. Interpret the clusters with respect to the numerical variables used in forming the clusters. 
  
  Cluster 1 - Row 11,17,13,15
  
  Cluster 2 - Row 21,7,10,4,16,19,3,1
  
  Cluster 3 - Row 5,20,14,9

  Cluster 4 - Row 12,8,6

  Cluster 5 - Row 18,2
  
  As above mention with the help of the following output =aggregate(Scale_Assign,by=list(Kmeans_N$cluster),FUN=mean)
 We can observe the followings
 
 Cluster 1 has highest Market_Cap,highest ROE,highest ROA,highest Asset_Turnover,highest Net_Profit_Margin.

Cluster 2 has highest Leverage,lowest Market_Cap, lowest Rev_Growth. 
  
Cluster 3 has highest PE_Ratio,lowest_ROE,lowest ROA,lowest Net_Profit_Margin,lowest Leverage.
  
Cluster 4 has lowest Beta.
  
Cluster 5 has highest Beta,highest Rev_Growth,lowest PE_Ratio,Lowest Asset_Turnover.

#C Is there a pattern in the clusters with respect to the numerical variables (10 to 12)? (those not used in 
forming the clusters) 

Cluster 1 has highest Market_Cap,highest ROE,highest ROA,highest         Asset_Turnover,highest Net_Profit_Margin with most of the cases of Median_Recommendation of Hold, Country US and exchange NYSE
 
Cluster 2 has highest Leverage with most of the cases of Median_Recommendation of Hold,Country Us and Exchange NYSE
 
 Cluster 3 has highest PE_Ratio with most of Median_Recommendation of equal Moderate buy and Moderate sell,and Exchange NYSE
 
Cluster 4 has lowest Beta with most of the Median_Recommendation of Hold, and Country US
 
Cluster 5 has highest Beta,highest Rev_Growth with most of the Median_Recommendation of equal Hold and Moderate Buy, and Exchange NYSE

So we can Conclude( in terms of Median_Recommendation,Country,Exchange)
Cluster 1,2,4 has most of the Median_Recommendation of Hold, Country US,Exchange NYSE(Only in Cluster 1 and 2)
Cluster 3 has equal Median_Recommendation of Moderate Buy and Moderate Sell, Exchange NYSE
Cluster 5 has equal Median_Recommendation of Hold and Moderate Buy, Exchange NYSE

#D Provide an appropriate name for each cluster using any or all of the variables in the dataset.

 Cluster 1 Stellar (has highest Market_Cap,highest ROE,highest ROA,highest Asset_Turnover,highest Net_Profit_Margin.)
 
 Cluster 2 Low (has highest Leverage,lowest Market_Cap, lowest Rev_Growth.)
 
 Cluster 3 Least (has highest PE_Ratio,lowest_ROE,lowest ROA,lowest Net_Profit_Margin,lowest Leverage.)
 
 Cluster 4 Medium (has only lowest Beta.)
 
 Cluster 5 Strong (has highest Beta,highest Rev_Growth,lowest PE_Ratio,Lowest Asset_Turnover.)
 
 I have name the clusters taking into consideration of only the numeric columns
 The orders are as follows
 1.Stellar
 2.Strong
 3.Medium
 4.Low
 5.Least
